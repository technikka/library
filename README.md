# Library

Simple beginnings of an app for storing information about books a user has read or wants to read. Being my first Javascript project since learning some foundations 3 years ago, the main goal was to reaquaint with the language. A secondary goal was to practice organizing Javascript code via objects.

## Features

I used this project as practice for:
* Pop-out form modal 
* Implementing keyboard support with tabindex and focus method.

## Notes / Reflections

* As for the goal of organizing my code into objects, I found very minimal use for this here. As this project was assigned on [Odin](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-library) to practice organizing with objects, i'll have to return in the near future and see what opportunities I missed.
